NVIDIA Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
This project applies deep learning to predict NVIDIA's stock prices using historical data and technical analysis indicators.

Key Components:
Data Preprocessing: The model scales NVIDIA's historical stock prices for effective training.
LSTM Model: A multi-layer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network designed to capture temporal patterns and trends in the stock market.
Technical Indicators: Includes features like RSI (Relative Strength Index) and Bollinger Bands to enhance the modelâ€™s predictive capability.
Results: Visual comparisons between predicted and actual stock prices for both training and testing data.
The project combines machine learning and financial analysis to explore stock price movement prediction.
